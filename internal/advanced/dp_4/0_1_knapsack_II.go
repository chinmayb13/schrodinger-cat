/*
Given two integer arrays A and B of size N each which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively.
Also given an integer C which represents knapsack capacity.
Find out the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.
NOTE: You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 500

1 <= C, B[i] <= 106

1 <= A[i] <= 50

Input Format
First argument is an integer array A of size N denoting the values on N items.

Second argument is an integer array B of size N denoting the weights on N items.

Third argument is an integer C denoting the knapsack capacity.

Output Format
Return a single integer denoting the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.

Example Input
Input 1:

	A = [6, 10, 12]
	B = [10, 20, 30]
	C = 50

Input 2:

	A = [1, 3, 2, 4]
	B = [12, 13, 15, 19]
	C = 10

Example Output
Output 1:

	22

Output 2:

	0

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

	Taking items with weight 20 and 30 will give us the maximum value i.e 10 + 12 = 22

Explanation 2:

	Knapsack capacity is 10 but each item has weight greater than 10 so no items can be considered in the knapsack therefore answer is 0.
